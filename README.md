##Technologies Used
This Akan Naming Application has been developed using the following technologies and methodologies
1. Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)

2. HTML5 - A scripting language for managing the layout and the image and text content of Webpage documents
3. JavaScript - A web based Front-end Object Oriented Programming language used to add functionality responsiveness and interactivity to webpages.
4. CSS- Cascading style sheets used to add styling, formatting and re-arranging webpage layout.

Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
This entails identifying the real world behaviour we wish to emulate in software that our final application program to be able to perform through code. 
We identify what the program should do first, then determine how to make it do it.

##Known Bugs
Possible bugs mainly associated with the use of JavaScript and its related functions which at times did not generate the expected output despite persistent debugging.

HTML 5 also exhibited issues with both the form and interactivity of thier date picker control which compounded the practicalness of its use for date data retrieval and even varied the standard day/month/year value to month/day/year making its use impractical.

CSS generated slight inconsistencies in terms of the difference between the left and right body margins despite being assigned the same value.
